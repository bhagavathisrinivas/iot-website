            <h1> How do IoT devices work?</h1>

            <p> Smartphones do play a large role in the IoT, however, because many IoT devices can be controlled through
                an app on a smartphone. You can use your smartphone to communicate with your smart thermostat, for
                example, to deliver the perfect temperature for you by the time you get home from work. Another plus?
                This can eliminate unneeded heating or cooling while you’re away, potentially saving you money on energy
                costs.

                IoT devices contain sensors and mini-computer processors that act on the data collected by the sensors
                via machine learning. Essentially, IoT devices are mini computers, connected to the internet, and are
                vulnerable to malware and hacking.

                Machine learning is when computers learn in a similar way to humans — by collecting data from their
                surroundings — and it is what makes IoT devices smart. This data can help the machine learn your
                preferences and adjust itself accordingly. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that
                helps computers learn without having to be programmed by someone.

                That doesn’t mean your smart speaker will discuss the key points of last night’s big game with you. But
                your connected refrigerator may send you an alert on your smartphone that you’re low on eggs and milk
                because it knows you’re near a supermarket.</p>

            <h1> What are the benefits of the IoT?</h1>
            <p> The Internet of Things is designed to make our lives more convenient. Here are a few examples:

                Smart bathroom scales working in tandem with your treadmill, delivering food preparation ideas to your
                laptop or smartphone, so you stay healthy.
                Security devices monitoring your home, turning lights on and off as you enter and exit rooms, and
                streaming video so you can check in while you’re away.
                Smart voice assistants placing your usual takeout order on command, making it a breeze to get fresh food
                delivered to your door.</p>

                <h1>A Brief History of IoT Technologies</h1>

                The term ‘Internet of Things’ was coined in 1999 by the computer scientist Kevin Ashton. While working
                at Procter & Gamble, Ashton proposed putting radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips on products to
                track them through a supply chain.

                He reportedly worked the then-buzzword ‘internet’ into his proposal to get the executives’ attention.
                And the phrase stuck.

                Over the next decade, public interest in IoT technology began to take off, as more and more connected
                devices came to market.

                In 2000, LG announced the first smart refrigerator, in 2007 the first iPhone was launched and by 2008,
                the number of connected devices exceeded the number of people on the planet.

                In 2009, Google started testing driverless cars and in 2011, Google’s Nest smart thermostat hit the
                market, which allowed remote control of central heating.The term ‘Internet of Things’ was coined in 1999
